"""Central declarative registry of all vllm-omni pipelines.

Mirrors the pattern in ``vllm/model_executor/models/registry.py``: each entry
is ``model_type -> (module_path, variable_name)``, and the module is imported
lazily on first lookup (see ``_LazyPipelineRegistry`` in
``vllm_omni/config/stage_config.py``). Keeping every pipeline declared in one
file makes it easy to spot a missing registration, which was the original
motivation in https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni/issues/2887 (item 4).

Per-model ``pipeline.py`` modules still define the ``PipelineConfig`` instance;
they just no longer need to self-register via ``register_pipeline(...)``.

Adding a new pipeline:
    1. Define the ``PipelineConfig`` instance as a module-level variable in
       ``vllm_omni/.../pipeline.py``.
    2. Add one line to ``_OMNI_PIPELINES`` or ``_DIFFUSION_PIPELINES`` below.

``register_pipeline(config)`` in ``stage_config`` is still supported for
out-of-tree plugins and tests that create pipelines at runtime; those override
the entries declared here.
